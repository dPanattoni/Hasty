# Hasty

### Hasty eases the process for moving Servicemembers worldwide with a cutting-edge web application built on the latest technology stack. Hasty is an MVP, so I can only provide snippets of the code I produced there due to the proprietary nature of the code. This repository contains React.js, .Net, and SQL code.

My role as a full stack software engineer was to create a robust filter feature and landing page, so that every visitor who navigated to the site's landing would have the ability to control the available listings displayed to them, based upon their own unique preferences. I accomplished this task through intensive critical thinking focused upon the frontend UI experience and an in depth understanding of backend data retreival, where the filtering ultimately takes place. Below is a descriptive list of actions that highlight my path to delivering this feature.

- Created a SQL stored procedure, utilizing User-Defined Table Types, Views, Inner Joins, Foreign Keys, and Pagination.
- Built API endpoint, Request Model, and Service Method using C# in Microsoft Visual Studio, utilizing DataTables and Mappers.
- Tested thoroughly for desired response and data shapes utilizing the Postman API.
- Created and nested multiple React components utilizing Formik, Bootstrap, Yup, and PropTypes for data validation and styling.
- Managed local repository using Git Bash for branches, commits, pulls, and pushes to GitHub remote repository.
- Performed frequent Pull Requests resulting in multiple successful merges into origin.
- Contributed to an Agile work environment by participating in and leading daily stand-ups, code reviews, code talks, and live debugging.
